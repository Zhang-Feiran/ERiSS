title: Ordinary Human Inquiry
---

## Learning Objectives
Through different learning experiences such as case studies and individual story-telling, learners will investigate the *motivations*, *methods*, and *impacts* of ordinary human inquiry, and work on their **social** and **communication** skills.

---

## Inquiry Questions
1. Why do we need to know?
2. How do we know what we know?
3. How do we know what we do not know?
4. How do we know what we know is true?
5. Do we make mistakes in the process of knowing?

## Learning Experiences
### Activity 1: Voyages of Inquiry 
In groups and with the help of additional research, examine the motivations, methods, and outcomes of the following cases:

|    Case    |    Link    |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 1 | [The Silk Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn3e37VWc0k&ab_channel=TED-Ed) |
| 2 | [James Cameron's Deepsea Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8r_-79SjpA&ab_channel=NationalGeographic) |
| 3 | [The Manhattan Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IqKdf6In_k&ab_channel=SciShow) |
| 4 | [Christopher Columbus's Discovery of America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E9T6UWaDRA&ab_channel=NativeAmericanHistory) |
| 5 | [The Story Behind mRNA Vaccines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3x4IMdeFdI&ab_channel=PennMedicine) |

Share your findings with other groups verbally. After sharing, discuss the following prompts:
- How do motivations shape methods?
- What ethical questions arise from exploration and inquiry?
- What are some lasting impacts of the exploration to date?

### Activity 2a: Personal Inquiry
Individually and with the help of platforms such as Padlet(R), share one of your personal inquiry examples with a focus on the following aspects:
- motivation(s) behind your inquiry
- approach(es) to your inquiry
- challenge(s) encountered
- outcome(s) attained

Once you have shared yours, you can explore and connect with others' inquiries and explorations for common aspects.

### Activity 2b: Collaborative Inquiry
Based on the connections established in Activity 2a, form your inquiry groups of 3-4 people. You may want to consider forming a group with
- people who share a lot of similarities in their personal inquiries to increase the chance of a shared interest
- people who share little to no similarity in their personal inquiries to increase diversity and the benefit therein

Once the group is formed, find a common interest among group members and design a mock "Exploration Proposal" with
- purposes of the exploration
- methods of the exploration
- anticipated challenges
- hoped-for outcomes

The mock "Exploration Proposal" shall be presented in the form of a poster to be presented in the following class.

## Key Understanding and Knowledge
- Inquiry and exploration are parts of human nature and are hardwired for better human survival and adaptation.
- Inquiry and exploration also fulfill higher-level needs for personal growth and [self-actualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).
- There are many different ways of knowing, broadly categorized into
   - direct observation and experience: sensory perception, emotions, intuition, logical reasoning
   - agreed-upon knowledge: authority, faith, traditions
- Different ways of knowing may be subject to different errors, for example
   - inaccurate observations
   - over-generalization
   - selective observations
   - logical fallacies
   - evolving, non-conforming realities
- To evaluate the validity of knowledge, humans rely on
   - logical support: theory
   - empirical support: evidence
