title: Social Scientific Inquiry
---

## Learning Objectives
Learners will explore features of inquiry that are specific and possibly unique to social sciences by examining their *scopes* and *methods*. With this understanding through different learning experiences, learners will appreciate the unique challenges and opportunities in social scientific inquiry, and continue to develop their **communication**, **social**, and **research** skills.

---

## Inquiry Questions
1. What are social sciences?
2. What questions do social scientists ask and seek to answer?
3. How do social scientists approach their inquiries, possibly differently?

## Learning Experiences

### Activity 1a: What Are Social Sciences?

Individually and with post-its or technology, write down as many specific disciplines that you consider to be part of social sciences as you can. Explain what these disciplines share in common and articulate why they all belong to social sciences. Highlight those disciplines about which you are interested in knowing more.

### Activity 1b: What Are Social Sciences About?

Based on Activity 1a, form groups of 3-4 learners with similar passions. Pick *one* social science discipline and investigate
- the discipline
  - a brief history of the discipline
  - the scope of the discipline
  - the methods and/or tools used by this discipline
- a *recent* (<20 years), *significant* (>200 citations) research paper in this discipline
  - its research question
  - its main finding(s)
  - its relation to big questions in the discipline

The end-products include
- a one-page poster with appropriate visual aids
- group presentation in 8-10 minutes

### Activity 1c: How Do Social Scientists Approach Their Inquiries?

Based on the sharing in Activity 1b, evaluate the following statements
- Social scientists aim to look for and explain general/aggregate patterns rather than specific/individual cases.
- Social scientists use data to construct new theories rather than using them to test exisiting theories.
- Social scientists rely more on quantitative data than qualitative data.

## Key Takeaways

- Social science is the "study of people, as individuals, communities, and societies; their behaviors and interactions with each other, and with their built, technological, and natural environments." ([Academy of Social Sciences](https://acss.org.uk/what-is-social-science/))
- Social sciences encompass many disciplines such as anthropology, economics, education, geography, international relations, political science, psychology, sociology, and more.
- Different social sciences ask different questions, but most of them revolve around humans, their behaviors, their interactions, and their constructs (e.g. markets, institutions, legal systems, forms of government, etc.)
- Social scientists rely on both theory (logic) and data (observation) to guide their inquiries; depending on the inquiry, they may use the data to construct or test a theory.
- Social scientists in general care more about general/aggregate patterns than specific/individual cases, and thus adopt nomothetic approach, seeking to understand the general or the aggregate.
- Some social scientific inquiries require the use of idiographic approach where specific or individual cases are to be understood.
- Again, depending on the inquiry, both quantitative and qualitative data will be used by the social scientists to address their research questions.
